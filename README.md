# Quantum ThermoLedger 

**Quantum ThermoLedger** is a blockchain-based system for validating quantum energy transitions and thermodynamic state changes. It combines principles of quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and blockchain technology to create an immutable ledger for scientific and industrial applications.

## Features

- **Quantum Energy Validation**:
  - Tracks electron transitions between energy levels.
  - Validates photon absorption/emission using Planck’s equation.
- **Thermodynamic State Tracking**:
  - Records phase transitions (solid ↔ liquid ↔ gas ↔ plasma).
  - Ensures compliance with thermodynamic laws (e.g., entropy, Gibbs free energy).
- **Rust-Powered Smart Contracts**:
  - Implements mathematical models for quantum and thermodynamic transitions.
  - Ensures energy/state changes follow scientific laws before logging.
- **Decentralized Verification**:
  - Uses Hyperledger Fabric for peer-to-peer validation.
  - Prevents tampering with cryptographic hashing.

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Hyperledger Fabric (Rust-based smart contracts).
- **Backend**: Rust (for physics models and validation logic).
- **Frontend**: React.js (for data visualization).
- **Simulation**: Python (for testing quantum/thermodynamic models).
